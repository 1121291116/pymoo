# TODO

- Deliver just .c files for pip to make the build independent from Cython

- Improve and write documentation for decomposition

- Add sidebar to homepage

- Write test suite for all algorithms (many problems just run once - no crash should occur)

- NSGA3 - add non-dom check finally (factor out the algorithm method and reuse)

- Remove image file from git history

- Add NoCrossover and NoMutation

- Rewrite integer operation with a wrapper

- Implement an async version of algorithms

- (mu,lambda) and (mu+lambda) difference

- Add global tests of all optimization methods

- Add mixed variable possibility

- PCX as crossover

- Decision Making (Pseudo Weight, ...)

- Termination Criteria in x space and fspace - xtol and ftol

- Statistics of Survival and more attributes for individuals

- Documentation fix link issues (absolute path at localhost and on remote)

- maybe include CMA-ES: https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma
- ask and tell interface

- elementwise function evaluation gradient is not working yet

- report None of infeasible or feasible




# DONE
- PCP values do have different ranges
- Add ZDT5 and show it for NSGA2
- 0.9 prob for crossover in general
- add normalization to radar - externalize from pcp
- Performance check nsga3
